Quality software from independent makers is like quality food from the farmer’s market. A jar of handmade organic jam is not the same as mass-produced corn syrup-laden jam from the supermarket.  
来自独立制造商的优质软件就像来自农贸市场的优质食品。一罐手工制作的有机果酱与超市里大量生产的玉米糖浆果酱不同。

Industrial fruit jam is filled with cheap ingredients and shelf stabilizers. Industrial software is filled with privacy-invasive trackers and proprietary formats.  
工业果酱充满了廉价的原料和货架稳定剂。工业软件充满了侵犯隐私的跟踪器和专有格式。

Google, Apple, and Microsoft make industrial software. Like industrial jam, industrial software has its benefits — it’s cheap, fairly reliable, widely available, and often gets the job done.  
谷歌、苹果和微软生产工业软件。与工业果酱一样，工业软件也有其优点——价格便宜、相当可靠、广泛可用，并且通常可以完成工作。

Big tech companies earn hundreds of billions of dollars and employ hundreds of thousands of people. When they make a new app, they can market it to their billions of customers easily. They have unbeatable leverage over the cost of developing and maintaining their apps.  
大型科技公司赚取数千亿美元并雇用数十万人。当他们制作新应用程序时，他们可以轻松地将其推销给数十亿客户。他们在开发和维护应用程序的成本方面拥有无与伦比的影响力。

Independent software makers are small teams that don’t have those economies of scale. They can try to compete on price by compromising their craft, or they can charge a fair price knowing this will drive a large number of people to choose big tech instead. Either way, big tech wins because they take a 20–30% cut of the app store money earned by most independent makers. A cost that the big tech companies do not incur.  
独立软件制造商都是小团队，不具备规模经济。他们可以尝试通过牺牲自己的技术来进行价格竞争，或者他们可以收取合理的价格，因为他们知道这将促使大量人选择大型科技公司。不管怎样，大型科技公司都会获胜，因为他们从大多数独立开发者在应用商店赚取的收入中抽取 20% 至 30% 的分成。大型科技公司不会承担这种成本。

Big tech companies have the ability to make their software cheap by subsidizing costs in a variety of ways:  
大型科技公司有能力通过多种方式补贴成本来降低软件成本：

*   Google sells highly profitable advertising and makes its apps free, but you are subjected to ads and privacy-invasive tracking.  
    谷歌销售利润丰厚的广告，并免费提供其应用程序，但您却会受到广告和侵犯隐私的跟踪的影响。
*   Apple sells highly profitable devices and makes its apps free, but locks you into a proprietary ecosystem.  
    苹果销售高利润的设备，并免费提供应用程序，但却将你锁定在专有的生态系统中。
*   Microsoft sells highly profitable enterprise contracts using a bundling strategy, and makes its apps cheap, also locking you into a proprietary ecosystem.  
    微软使用捆绑策略销售高利润的企业合同，并使其应用程序变得便宜，同时也将您锁定在专有的生态系统中。

Some tech companies raise hundreds of millions of dollars from [venture capital investors](https://stephango.com/vcware), and use this money to subsidize pricing — until the money runs out, and the quality soon declines.  
一些科技公司从风险投资投资者那里筹集了数亿美元，并用这笔钱来补贴定价——直到资金用完，质量很快下降。

I’m not saying these companies are evil. But their subsidies create the illusion that all software should be cheap or free.  
我并不是说这些公司是邪恶的。但他们的补贴造成了一种错觉，即所有软件都应该便宜或免费。

Industrial software has become so incredibly cheap that most of us have lost the sense for how much value a quality piece of software can provide. We have become numb to the taste of good software and hypnotized by the idea of “free”.  
工业软件已经变得非常便宜，以至于我们大多数人已经失去了高质量软件可以提供多少价值的意识。我们已经对优秀软件的品味变得麻木，并被“免费”的理念所催眠。

I’m not sure why, but we seem more willing to spend money on good fruit jam than on good software. I notice that I spend less on personal software than I do on groceries and many basic things. Yet software is one of the few things I pay for that truly gives me leverage. Consider its [cost per use](https://stephango.com/buy-wisely).  
我不知道为什么，但我们似乎更愿意花钱买好的果酱而不是好的软件。我注意到我在个人软件上的花费比在杂货和许多基本物品上的花费要少。然而，软件是我花钱购买的少数真正能给我带来影响力的东西之一。考虑每次使用的成本。

Independent makers of quality software go out of their way to make apps that are _better for you_. They take a principled approach to making tools that don’t compromise your privacy, and [don’t lock you in](https://stephango.com/file-over-app).  
优质软件的独立制造商竭尽全力打造更适合您的应用程序。他们采用原则性方法来制作不会损害您的隐私、也不会将您锁定的工具。

Independent software makers are people you can talk to. Like quality jam from the farmer’s market, you might become friends with the person who made it — they’ll listen to your suggestions and your complaints.  
独立软件开发者是你可以与之交谈的人。就像农贸市场的优质果酱一样，您可能会与制作果酱的人成为朋友 \- 他们会听取您的建议和投诉。

If you want to live in a world with more than a handful of software makers, then spend a bit more on quality independent software. It deserves your hard-earned cash.  
如果你想生活在一个拥有多个软件制造商的世界，那么就多花一点钱购买高质量的独立软件。它值得你辛苦赚来的钱。
