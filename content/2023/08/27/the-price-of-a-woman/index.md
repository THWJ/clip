I often write about amazing things I read in books. But sometimes I feel the need to write about things I haven't read in a book, because I have failed to find a book that should exist.  

我经常写我在书上读到的令人惊奇的事情。但有时我觉得有必要写一些我没有读过的东西，因为我没有找到一本应该存在的书。

The question why some societies require men to pay brideprices while other societies require women to bring a dowry to a union is one of those questions. There should be a good book somewhere that explains this.   

为什么有些社会要求男子支付彩礼，而另一些社会要求妇女为工会带来嫁妆，这是这些问题之一。应该有一本好书在某处解释这一点。

I haven’t found that good book. There is a book from 1971, _Bridewealth and Dowry_ by Jack Goody and Stanley J Tambiah. It builds on economist [Esther Boserup's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ester_Boserup) theory that there is a strong correlation between dowry and plow agriculture (predominantly run by men) and brideprice and hoe agriculture (predominantly run by women). And there are a number of more or less obscure papers. But I miss _the_ explanation to why resources sometimes flow from the families of women to the new household (dowry) and sometimes from the groom or the groom's family to the wife's family (brideprice).   

我还没有找到那本好书。有一本1971年的书，杰克·古迪和斯坦利·J·坦比亚的《新娘与嫁妆》。它建立在经济学家埃丝特·博塞鲁普（Esther Boserup）的理论之上，即嫁妆和犁地农业（主要由男性经营）与彩礼和锄头农业（主要由女性经营）之间存在很强的相关性。还有一些或多或少晦涩难懂的论文。但我错过了解释为什么资源有时从妇女家庭流向新家庭（嫁妆），有时从新郎或新郎的家庭流向妻子的家庭（彩礼）。

For that reason, I'm writing yet another blog post on a subject that really merits a book: The link between population density and marriage payments. It is a messy subject with loads of data and details. Giving it any justice would require a book. Since I don't have the time to write that book or any resources to market it, I only analyze the most obvious patterns.  

出于这个原因，我正在写另一篇关于一个真正值得一本书的主题的博客文章：人口密度和婚姻支付之间的联系。这是一个混乱的主题，有大量的数据和细节。给它任何正义都需要一本书。由于我没有时间写那本书或任何资源来推销它，所以我只分析最明显的模式。

I use the terms brideprice for the custom of buying a woman from her family for marriage. I use the term dowry for the custom that a woman's family makes a contribution to the household their daughter forms with a man. Historically, brideprice and dowry were not equivalents. A brideprice was paid to a woman's family. It was commonly used to buy wives for the bride's male family members. A dowry was a form of early inheritance paid at the time of the wedding. The purpose of the dowry was to enrich the household of which a daughter would be part to the benefit of the dowry-payers' grandchildren.   

我使用彩礼一词来表示从她的家庭中购买女人结婚的习俗。我使用嫁妆一词来表示一种习俗，即妇女的家庭为女儿与男人组成的家庭做出贡献。从历史上看，彩礼和嫁妆并不等同。向妇女的家庭支付彩礼。它通常用于为新娘的男性家庭成员购买妻子。嫁妆是在婚礼时支付的一种早期遗产形式。嫁妆的目的是使女儿成为其中一部分的家庭致富，以造福嫁妆支付者的孙子孙女。

Nowadays, the word "dowry" is heavily connected to modern-day India, where parents started to demand a kind of groomprice for the human capital invested in a son. This is a late-day phenomenon of a post-agricultural society that kept some agricultural customs. It is not at all typical in history, not even in the history of India itself.

More about that further down.  

如今，“嫁妆”这个词与现代印度密切相关，在那里，父母开始要求为投资于儿子的人力资本提供一种修饰价格。这是后农业社会的后期现象，保留了一些农业习俗。这在历史上根本不是典型的，甚至在印度本身的历史上也不是。1 更多关于这一点。

First of all: According to economic theory, prices are set by supply and demand. For that reason I'm feeling a bit annoyed with the fairness assumption behind much of the thinking around the marriage transfer question. For example, it is said that virilocal societies where women do a lot of agricultural work tend to be brideprice societies, because losing the labor of a daughter is seen as a cost that needs to be compensated.

The way that theory is formulated makes me wonder: Since when do human societies strive for fairness? The reason why human societies tend to be unfair one way or the other is that people seldom give resources away when they can avoid it. If men pay for women, they probably do so because they need to make a bid to compete with other men for relatively scarce women.  

首先：根据经济理论，价格是由供求关系决定的。出于这个原因，我对围绕婚姻转移问题的大部分思考背后的公平假设感到有点恼火。例如，据说妇女从事大量农业劳动的virilocal社会往往是彩礼社会，因为失去女儿的劳动被视为需要补偿的成本。2 理论的表述方式让我想知道：人类社会从什么时候开始争取公平？人类社会之所以倾向于这样或那样不公平，是因为人们在可以避免资源的时候很少放弃资源。如果男人为女人买单，他们这样做可能是因为他们需要与其他男人竞争相对稀缺的女性。

Then the question becomes: Why would the supply and demand of women vary between societies? Why are there sometimes so few women that parents are paid to raise them, and sometimes so many women that parents need to sugar-coat them with resources to make them attractive enough as marriage partners?  

那么问题就变成了：为什么女性的供求关系在不同社会之间会有所不同？为什么有时女性如此之少，以至于父母有报酬抚养她们，有时如此多的女性需要用资源来粉饰她们，以使她们成为足够的婚姻伴侣？

There is no reason to question Esther Boserup's observation that hoe agriculture societies that rely on female agricultural labor mostly practice brideprice and plow agriculture societies that rely on male agricultural labor are more keen on practicing dowry. The interesting question is: _Why_ do some societies practice hoe agriculture and other practice plow agriculture?  

没有理由质疑埃丝特·博塞鲁普（Esther Boserup）的观察，即依赖女性农业劳动的锄头农业社会大多实行彩礼，而依赖男性农业劳动的耕作农业社会更热衷于实践嫁妆。有趣的问题是：为什么有些社会实行锄头农业，而另一些社会实行犁耕农业？

I think the answer is population density. As long as men can, they will employ women to do most of the hard and dirty work. As long as it is possible for a man to use martial prowess and social skills to amass a harem of wives who will sustain themselves and their children with their work, the men who focus on exactly that will win the evolutionary race. The men who peacefully focus on feeding the children they have with one woman will not be the most successful.  

我认为答案是人口密度。只要男人可以，他们就会雇用女人做大部分艰苦而肮脏的工作。只要一个男人有可能利用武术和社交技巧来积累一个后宫的妻子，这些妻子会用工作养活自己和孩子，那么专注于这一点的男人就会赢得进化竞赛。那些和平地专注于喂养他们与一个女人生的孩子的男人不会是最成功的。

As long as mortality among adults and children is high enough, having too many children is not a problem. Sons can try their luck as warriors. Under very primitive conditions, they can raid the neighbors and steal a wife. Under somewhat less primitive conditions, they can raid the neighbors and steal cattle and buy a wife. Daughters, if they can be protected from those neighbors long enough, can be exchanged for new wives to their brothers or fathers.  

只要成人和儿童的死亡率足够高，孩子太多就不是问题。儿子可以试试战士的运气。在非常原始的条件下，他们可以突袭邻居并偷走妻子。在不太原始的条件下，他们可以突袭邻居，偷牛并买妻子。女儿，如果她们能从这些邻居那里得到足够长的保护，可以换取新的妻子给她们的兄弟或父亲。

As long as feeding children is not a major concern for men, they will benefit from having as many as possible. In such an environment they will want as many wives as possible. For that reason, there will be a great demand for women of marriageable age. They will be bargained for, kidnapped and sold, in every society with anything to buy and sell.  

只要喂养孩子不是男人的主要关注点，他们就会从尽可能多的孩子中受益。在这样的环境中，他们会想要尽可能多的妻子。因此，对适婚年龄的妇女的需求将很大。他们将在每个社会中被讨价还价、绑架和出售，有任何东西可以买卖。

The great demand for females will make them difficult to protect. Which will make them costly to raise. Managing to protect a daughter until her reproductive years is rewarded with a brideprice. That brideprice can be used to pay for buying the protected daughters of other people.  

对女性的巨大需求将使她们难以保护。这将使它们的筹集成本很高。设法保护女儿，直到她的生育年龄获得彩礼奖励。彩礼可以用来支付购买别人受保护的女儿的费用。

The only reason why this system didn't last forever, everywhere, is that eventually, societies somehow got more peaceful. Mortality became lower and the population increased. Which made land a scarce resource. Extensive hoe agriculture by women was no longer efficient enough to sustain children - it required too much land. In such an environment, men face a choice: See their children succumb or work harder themselves. Those who chose the latter became evolutionarily successful. Plowing with animals is hard work and requires the upper body strength of a man. But it gives more output from a given area. When land became scarce, the men who were prepared to work their limited amount of land themselves got more surviving children.  

这个系统没有在任何地方永远持续下去的唯一原因是，最终，社会以某种方式变得更加和平。死亡率降低，人口增加。这使得土地成为稀缺资源。妇女粗放的锄头农业不再有效，无法养活孩子，这需要太多的土地。在这样的环境中，男人面临着一个选择：看着他们的孩子屈服或自己更加努力地工作。那些选择后者的人在进化上取得了成功。与动物一起耕作是一项艰苦的工作，需要男人的上半身力量。但它提供了来自给定区域的更多输出。当土地变得稀缺时，那些准备自己在有限的土地上工作的人得到了更多幸存的孩子。

For those plowmen, wives weren't as useful anymore. They still needed one wife to give them a number of children to provide for. But since they had to provide for all children with their own labor, they had no interest in having an infinite number of children. For that reason, most men stopped bargaining for additional wives. Women who gave birth to children _and_ provided for those children themselves were simply much more desirable for men than women who gave birth to children the man had to provide for.  

对于那些犁夫来说，妻子不再那么有用了。他们仍然需要一个妻子来给他们一些孩子来供养。但是，由于他们必须用自己的劳动为所有孩子提供服务，因此他们对拥有无限数量的孩子没有兴趣。出于这个原因，大多数男人停止为额外的妻子讨价还价。生孩子并自己供养这些孩子的妇女对男人来说比生下男人必须供养的孩子的女人更受欢迎。

When men needed to provide for their children with their own labor, their tastes changed. From the quantity of women, to the quality of one woman. Actually, such scarce conditions made the interests of the sexes converge like never before. Men are physically capable of having many more children than any woman. But in a Malthusian society where land is scarce, they mostly need to forego such opportunities if they want any surviving children and grandchildren. Under Malthusian conditions, humans get heavily [K-selected](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R/K_selection_theory). The men who adapt to such conditions get selected for.   

当男人需要用自己的劳动养活孩子时，他们的口味发生了变化。从女性的数量，到一个女性的素质。实际上，这种稀缺的条件使两性的利益前所未有地趋同。男人在身体上比任何女人都能生更多的孩子。但在土地稀缺的马尔萨斯社会中，如果他们想要任何幸存的子孙后代，他们大多需要放弃这样的机会。在马尔萨斯条件下，人类被严重选择K。适应这种条件的男人被选中。

All-in-all, this makes men and women more similar in their lifestyle and partner preferences. To the degree that women have been allowed to choose their partners, they have always stressed quality rather than quantity. Under crowded conditions where few people can realistically hope for more than a handful of children, men start doing the same. And in an economy where resources to feed one's children is the most crucial asset, a "high-quality woman" means a woman with resources. Enter the dowry economy.  

总而言之，这使得男性和女性在生活方式和伴侣偏好方面更加相似。在允许妇女选择伴侣的程度上，她们总是强调质量而不是数量。在拥挤的条件下，很少有人能现实地希望有几个孩子，男人也开始这样做。在一个养活孩子的资源是最重要的资产的经济中，“高素质的女性”意味着拥有资源的女性。进入嫁妆经济。

In a population-dense society with rather low mortality levels, men know they will only be able to sustain a number of children. They will be able to provide an even smaller number of children with an inheritance, securing food for their grandchildren.  

在一个人口密集、死亡率相当低的社会中，男人知道他们只能养活一些孩子。他们将能够为数量更少的孩子提供遗产，为他们的孙子孙女提供食物。

Marriageable women and their parents will look for one thing: A man who owns land. That gives men who own some land the power to choose. They will use that leverage to choose a woman who brings more land into the deal. Because essentially, both sexes are in the same situation: Land ownership is the great obstacle to their opportunity to have children and grandchildren.  

适婚妇女和她们的父母会寻找一件事：拥有土地的男人。这给了拥有一些土地的人选择的权力。他们将利用这种影响力来选择一位为交易带来更多土地的女性。因为从本质上讲，两性处于相同的境地：土地所有权是他们生育子女和孙辈的机会的最大障碍。

In population-dense societies, men and their parents learn that a woman in herself doesn't lead to optimal reproductive success. Only a woman bundled with resources does. So they narrow down their choice of a wife to a suitably propertied class of women. Women of that class do their best to distinguish themselves from less propertied women through visibly wearing some of their property. The exhibition of resources in the form of jewelry and elaborate dress becomes a means for young women and their parents to show that their daughters are in the pool of resource-endowed women whose children are likely to have a future in a crowded society.  

在人口稠密的社会中，男性和他们的父母了解到，女性本身并不能带来最佳的生育成功。只有与资源捆绑在一起的女人才会这样做。因此，他们将妻子的选择范围缩小到适当有产的女性阶层。这个阶层的妇女尽最大努力通过明显地穿着她们的一些财产来将自己与不太富裕的妇女区分开来。以珠宝和精致服饰的形式展示资源成为年轻妇女及其父母的一种手段，以表明她们的女儿属于资源丰富的妇女，她们的孩子很可能在拥挤的社会中拥有未来。

The above was what happened in Europe. At first, population was sparse and land was plentiful. In the northern parts of Europe, it remained so until a millennium ago or so. When larger military units were formed, peace and population increase ensued. More labor-intensive, less land-demanding agricultural practices took over. Peace decreased kidnapping risks, which made raising daughters less costly. The Christian church banned infantice and was more capable of actually enforcing the ban. By the 1000s, women of reproductive age had both become cheaper to raise and less in demand. In order to compete for grooms, parents started to sugar-coat their daughters with resources.  

以上是欧洲发生的事情。起初，人口稀少，土地充足。在欧洲北部，这种情况一直持续到一千年前左右。当更大的军事单位成立时，和平与人口增加随之而来。劳动密集度更高、土地需求更低的农业实践占据了主导地位。和平降低了绑架风险，使抚养女儿的成本降低。基督教会禁止婴儿，并且更有能力实际执行禁令。到1000年代，育龄妇女的饲养成本和需求都变得减少。为了争夺新郎，父母开始用资源给女儿涂糖。

In East Asia, most of the above happened too. Larger political units were created. Which led to peace, which led to a Malthusian situation. And still, dowry payments did not become an important part of the culture in much of East Asia. Men actually continued paying for brides.   

在东亚，上述大部分情况也发生了。创建了更大的政治单位。这导致了和平，导致了马尔萨斯主义的局面。尽管如此，嫁妆支付并没有成为东亚大部分地区文化的重要组成部分。男人实际上继续为新娘付钱。

In East Asia just like in Europe, more peaceful and crowded conditions made women plummet in value. As always, the demand for women followed the demand for children. When fewer children were in demand due to lack of food and future prospects, fewer women were in demand as well. But the Asians took another measure than the Europeans: Infanticide. Instead of stimulating the demand for women through bundling them with resources, Asian families simply cut the supply. The families of sons then paid the families of daughters some compensation for not having killed their daughter.  

在东亚就像在欧洲一样，更加和平和拥挤的条件使女性的价值直线下降。与往常一样，对妇女的需求跟随对儿童的需求。当由于缺乏食物和未来前景而需要的儿童减少时，需要的妇女也较少。但亚洲人采取了比欧洲人更严格的措施：杀婴。亚洲家庭没有通过捆绑资源来刺激对女性的需求，而是简单地削减了供应。然后，儿子的家人向女儿的家庭支付了一些赔偿，因为他们没有杀死他们的女儿。

For that reason, I wouldn't say that dowry payments is a law that comes with the Malthusian condition. Rather, they come when living conditions get crowded and the supply of women cannot be restricted in a socially acceptable way.   

出于这个原因，我不会说嫁妆支付是马尔萨斯条件附带的法律。相反，当生活条件变得拥挤，妇女的供应无法以社会可接受的方式受到限制时，它们就会出现。

As many people have observed, Africa is the big brideprice economy of modern times. As Ester Boserup observed, since African agriculture centered around female labor, brideprice was the rule.  

正如许多人所观察到的，非洲是现代最大的彩礼经济。正如Ester Boserup所观察到的那样，由于非洲农业以女性劳动力为中心，彩礼是规则。

There is no reason to question that: Africa really is known for its female-led, non-plow agriculture. Geographical reasons have been cited, like soil quality and suitable crops: Maize is rather easy to hoe cultivate, and it suits the climate in much of Africa. But soil geography can't be the whole truth. It is not like European colonists gave their wives hoes and digging sticks when they arrived in South Africa because the soil was so suitable for female labor. Once upon a time, all agriculture was hoe agriculture, also in northern Europe. Ultimately, it is population density that makes societies take the step from less labor-intense female-led agriculture to more labor-intense male-led agriculture.  

没有理由质疑这一点：非洲确实以其女性主导的非犁耕农业而闻名。人们引用了地理原因，例如土壤质量和合适的作物：玉米很容易耕种，并且适合非洲大部分地区的气候。但土壤地理学不可能是全部真相。这不像欧洲殖民者在抵达南非时给他们的妻子锄头和挖掘棍子，因为那里的土壤非常适合女性劳动力。曾几何时，所有的农业都是锄头农业，北欧也是如此。最终，正是人口密度使社会从劳动密集度较低的女性主导的农业向劳动密集型男性主导的农业迈出了一步。

Before the 20th century, Africa never became densely populated. Wars, but above all nasty diseases kept population numbers down. Mortality remained high, so the population pressure that forced men into plow agriculture never arrived.   

在20世纪之前，非洲从未变得人口稠密。战争，但最重要的是令人讨厌的疾病使人口数量下降。死亡率居高不下，因此迫使人们从事犁地农业的人口压力从未到来。

One peculiar fact underlines the specific nature of Africa in population matters: African men father more daughters than European, Asian and Native American men. When the father is of African origin, sex ratios tend to lie around 103 boys for 100 girls, compared to 106-107 for other ethnicities.

  

一个奇特的事实突显了非洲在人口问题上的特殊性质：非洲男子生的女儿多于欧洲、亚洲和美洲原住民男子。当父亲是非洲血统时，性别比例往往在103个男孩对100个女孩左右，而其他种族的性别比例为106-107。3 

This could be a direct effect of genetic drift: The few hundred people who went out of Africa and became the ancestors of all non-Africans might have had a higher tendency to father boys. But given the advantage of more than fifty percent male offspring in many human societies, it wouldn't be entirely strange if a tendency to father more sons than daughters was selected for. The reason why such tendencies weren't as much selected for in Africa might have been malaria. Since malaria in itself was such a killer, the need for killer males decreased compared to the need for breeding females. Groups that could keep their numbers up in the face of disease pressure might have had more of an advantage compared to in the rest of the world, where nature allowed more people to grow up and kill each other.  

这可能是遗传漂变的直接影响：走出非洲并成为所有非非洲人的祖先的几百人可能更倾向于生男孩。但是，考虑到许多人类社会中超过百分之五十的男性后代的优势，如果选择父亲多于女儿的倾向，也就不完全奇怪了。这种趋势在非洲没有被选中的原因可能是疟疾。由于疟疾本身就是一个杀手，与繁殖雌性的需求相比，对杀手雄性的需求减少了。与世界其他地区相比，能够在疾病压力面前保持人数增长的群体可能更具优势，因为自然允许更多的人成长并互相残杀。

During the 20th century, when modern medicine reduced the mortality in Africa, population numbers soared. Birth rates have decreased, but not nearly to the levels of countries of similar wealth in the rest of the world (for example, Nigeria has two and a half times the fertility rate of comparably affluent India). There might still be a mentality from the continent's empty history, reflected in the still widely practiced custom of brideprice: There are even [reports](https://nation.africa/kenya/blogs-opinion/opinion/the-bride-price-app-that-got-people-talking-1143248) of apps that help people calculate the right price for their daughter.   

在20世纪，当现代医学降低非洲的死亡率时，人口数量飙升。出生率有所下降，但远未达到世界其他地区类似财富国家的水平（例如，尼日利亚的生育率是相对富裕的印度的两倍半）。非洲大陆空洞的历史可能仍然存在一种心态，反映在仍然广泛实行的彩礼习俗中：甚至有报道称，应用程序可以帮助人们为女儿计算合适的价格。

Reports from India probably are what first taught most of us the word "_dowry_". The persistence of the custom of wealth transfers from the families of wives to the families of grooms gives the impression that the custom is very old. Surprisingly, it doesn't seem to be. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dowry_system_in_India) cites several ancient sources claiming that dowries were not paid in India.

Sarah Hrdy reports that in the lower castes, brideprice is still the norm: Low status men need to pay to get married.

  

来自印度的报道可能是我们大多数人第一次教给我们“嫁妆”这个词的原因。财富从妻子家庭转移到新郎家庭的习俗的持续存在给人的印象是这种习俗非常古老。令人惊讶的是，它似乎不是。维基百科引用了几个古代资料，声称印度没有支付嫁妆。4 莎拉·赫迪（Sarah Hrdy）报告说，在低种姓中，彩礼仍然是常态：地位低下的男人需要付费才能结婚。5

One important difference between India and Europe was the strong and formalized tradition of hypergamy in India. In Europe, two young persons of roughly equal class were usually brought together, each of them endowed with inherited wealth. In India, people were supposed to endow their daughters to buy them a place on a higher social level. In the 19th century in some Northern Indian high castes, all daughters were killed at birth, because where would they go?

  

印度和欧洲的一个重要区别是印度强大而正式的超一夫一妻制传统。在欧洲，两个阶级大致相等的年轻人通常聚集在一起，每个人都被赋予继承的财富。在印度，人们应该赋予女儿以在更高的社会层面上为她们买一个地方。在19世纪，在北印度的一些高种姓中，所有的女儿在出生时都被杀死，因为她们会去哪里？6

From India there actually seems to be some evidence of a groom-price custom. In most places, the dowry clearly went to the household of the daughter to the benefit of her children. However, in northern India Stanley S Tambiah found blurred lines between the dowry and the rest of the finances of the husband's extended family.

  

实际上，从印度似乎有一些新郎价格习俗的证据。在大多数地方，嫁妆显然是给女儿家的，以造福她的孩子。然而，在印度北部，斯坦利·S·坦比亚（Stanley S Tambiah）发现嫁妆与丈夫大家庭的其他财务之间的界限模糊不清。7

When land was replaced by human capital as the most important asset, most societies abandoned explicit dowry payments. But not in India. Instead, the tradition of buying a place in a higher social class continued. Many parents of sons find it fair that they should get some of the money they invested in their son's education back. If they take in a woman into the social class where they have paid to be, shouldn't her family pay for an entry ticket too?

  

当土地被人力资本取代成为最重要的资产时，大多数社会放弃了明确的嫁妆支付。但不是在印度。相反，在较高社会阶层中购买位置的传统仍在继续。许多儿子的父母认为，他们应该把他们投资于儿子教育的一些钱拿回来是公平的。如果他们把一个女人收进他们付钱的社会阶层，她的家人不应该也付一张入场券吗？8

They say that in the Western world, brideprice and dowry are lost traditions. Brideprice definitely is: Parents of young women are not paid when their daughters get married.  

他们说，在西方世界，彩礼和嫁妆是失传的传统。彩礼肯定是：年轻女性的父母在女儿结婚时没有报酬。

But I'm not so sure the dowry tradition has been lost. Actually, parents still invest quite a lot in the social standing of their children. But they invest in other things than in pre-modern times. Instead of transferable assets like land, they help their children build up their individual human capital.  

但我不太确定嫁妆传统已经消失了。实际上，父母仍然在孩子的社会地位上投入了大量资金。但他们投资于其他事情，而不是前现代。他们不是像土地这样的可转让资产，而是帮助他们的孩子建立个人人力资本。

The pre-modern dowry system was adapted to an environment where women moved away from their kin while men stayed at the family property. Today, both men and women are supposed to move away from their parents and create entirely new households. In that sense, both boys and girls are in the same situation as girls were a few hundred years ago.  

前现代的嫁妆制度适应了妇女离开亲属而男子留在家庭财产的环境。今天，男人和女人都应该离开父母，建立全新的家庭。从这个意义上说，男孩和女孩的处境都与几百年前的女孩相同。

Parents are still doing their best to support their children, both directly and indirectly. Direct help in the form of financial aid to buy a house or other capital goods is not unheard of although still somewhat frowned upon. But indirect help in the form of the best education the parents can buy and the best upbringing they can provide is more or less seen as the norm. Parents might not even be aware of it themselves but what they are doing is helping their children secure the best possible spot on the marriage market . Just like during the times when dowries were paid out at the occasion of a marriage, people know that the best way to form a family with high social status is to combine a high-status man and a high-status woman. Two high salaries simply buy a nicer inner-city apartment than only one high salary.  

父母仍在尽最大努力直接或间接地支持他们的孩子。以经济援助的形式直接帮助购买房屋或其他资本货物并非闻所未闻，尽管仍然有些不受欢迎。但是，以父母可以购买的最好的教育和他们可以提供的最好的教养形式提供的间接帮助或多或少被视为常态。父母甚至可能自己都没有意识到这一点，但他们正在做的是帮助他们的孩子在婚姻市场上获得最好的位置。就像在结婚时支付嫁妆的时代一样，人们知道组建一个社会地位高的家庭的最好方法是将高地位的男人和高地位的女人结合起来。两个高薪只是买一个更好的市中心公寓，而不是只有一个高薪。

For that reason I wouldn't say that the dowry tradition is dead. It has rather been extended to both sexes. Now, just like before, young people who have not received help from parents or kin to rise socially have a much harder time rising to new social heights and finding a mate on that higher social level.  

出于这个原因，我不会说嫁妆传统已经死了。相反，它已经扩展到两性。现在，就像以前一样，没有从父母或亲属那里得到帮助的年轻人在社交上上升到新的社会高度并在更高的社会水平上找到伴侣要困难得多。

The main difference compared to the agricultural society of yesterday is that far from all people in the marriage market are there with the aim of breeding. In crowded societies there is always a market for sex-without-breeding, usually in the form of prostitution. Through prostitution, men got an outlet for their no longer success-bringing instinct to have sex with as many and as fertile women as possible. As such, prostitution harks back to an even more ancient time when men earned gene-spreading opportunities through appreciating all fertile women, regardless of social status.  

与昨天的农业社会相比，主要区别在于，婚姻市场上的大多数人远非都是以繁殖为目的的。在拥挤的社会中，总是有一个没有繁殖的性行为的市场，通常是以卖淫的形式。通过卖淫，男人得到了一个发泄他们不再成功的本能的出口，即与尽可能多的、有生育能力的女性发生性关系。因此，卖淫可以追溯到一个更古老的时代，当时男性通过欣赏所有有生育能力的女性来获得基因传播的机会，无论其社会地位如何。

As social norms regarding sexuality and reproduction were loosened, the two systems got blurred. We still have a very obvious dowry economy, where richly endowed men and women form even more endowed couples. But we also have a market of lust, where the focus lies on lust for naked beauty, like it did in ancient, uncrowded societies. The first, dowry-based, system is supposed to result in children. The latter, lust-based, system is not. Nonetheless, people in the two systems mingle freely on a common relationship market.  

随着有关性和生殖的社会规范的放松，这两个系统变得模糊不清。我们仍然有一个非常明显的嫁妆经济，富有的男人和女人组成了更多的捐赠夫妇。但我们也有欲望市场，其重点是对裸体美的欲望，就像在古老、不拥挤的社会中所做的那样。第一种以嫁妆为基础的制度应该产生孩子。后者，基于欲望的系统不是。尽管如此，这两个系统中的人们在一个共同的关系市场上自由地交往。

This makes life difficult especially for those in the dowry section of the relationship market. The lust-focused section does not mind very much if they catch a lust-based or a dowry-based individual from the market pool. But a dowry-focused participant does not want to waste time on someone only in it for the lust.   

这使得生活变得困难，特别是对于那些在关系市场的嫁妆部分的人来说。以情欲为重点的部分并不介意他们是否从市场池中抓住一个基于欲望或基于嫁妆的个人。但是，一个专注于嫁妆的参与者不想把时间浪费在仅仅为了欲望的人身上。

Yesterday, amassing a fortune big enough to marry was the main  difficulty for men and women who wanted to form families. Today, amassing the earning power is only the first step. The second step is to avoid squandering it on people who do not even intend to form families. On that point, we might be experiencing cultural evolution in real time: Families and communities whose young people are able to avoid such pitfalls are at an advantage compared to families and communities where the kids spend their time and resources dating their way into reproductive dead-ends.  

昨天，积累足够大的财富结婚是想要组建家庭的男人和女人的主要困难。今天，积累赚钱能力只是第一步。第二步是避免将其浪费在甚至不打算组建家庭的人身上。在这一点上，我们可能正在实时体验文化演变：与孩子们花费时间和资源进入生殖死胡同的家庭和社区相比，年轻人能够避免此类陷阱的家庭和社区处于优势地位。

The cultural evolution of uncrowded, high mortality societies favored families that amassed resources and used them to pay the brideprice for women. The cultural evolution of crowded agricultural societies favored families that amassed resources and used dowry payments to combine them. Today's cultural evolution favors families that both endow their children and help those children use their endowment to maximal reproductive effect.  

不拥挤、高死亡率社会的文化演变有利于那些积累资源并利用这些资源为妇女支付彩礼的家庭。拥挤的农业社会的文化演变有利于那些积累资源并使用嫁妆支付来组合它们的家庭。今天的文化演变有利于既赋予孩子又帮助这些孩子利用他们的禀赋来最大化生殖效果的家庭。
