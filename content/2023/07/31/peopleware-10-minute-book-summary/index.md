What makes you panic more – a plugged-in iron left on, or leaving your phone at home?   

什么让你更恐慌-一个插入式熨斗离开，或离开你的手机在家里？

It’s obvious that an iron can cause much more damage, but the idea of having to spend a day without a phone sounds like madness. We are highly dependent on modern technologies – probably more than we think we are. It may seem that technology rules the world today… but is it so?  

很明显，熨斗会造成更大的伤害，但不得不花一天没有手机的想法听起来像疯了。我们对现代技术的依赖程度很高--可能比我们想象的还要高。技术似乎统治着当今世界，但事实果真如此吗？

“Peopleware: Productive Projects and Teams” by Tom De Marco and Timothy Lister tells us that software engineering is inherently sociological. The authors insist that problems appearing in the sphere are mostly social, and not technological in nature.   

“人件：由Tom De Marco和Timothy Lister所著的“生产性项目和团队”告诉我们软件工程本质上是社会学的。作者坚持认为，该领域出现的问题大多是社会性的，而不是技术性的。

However, company leaders just don’t manage that way – even more, sometimes they treat people as if they were modular components, like software routines or circuits. But people are not machines – they are extremely complex creatures. And once you find a key to fix an issue at the “human” level, the technological part can resolve itself.  

然而，公司领导者并不是这样管理的--甚至有时候，他们对待员工就像对待模块化组件一样，就像软件程序或电路一样。但人不是机器--他们是极其复杂的生物。一旦你找到了解决“人”层面问题的关键，技术部分就可以自行解决。

Here you can read a short summary of “Peopleware” by DeMarco and Lister:

## Part I. Managing the human resource  

第一部分人力资源管理

A tendency to organize human resources into modular pieces has its logical background: usually software team managers are ex-technicians and developers who are used to working in this way. This approach is ineffective and counterproductive. Fortunately, there is an alternative.   

将人力资源组织成模块化的趋势有其逻辑背景：通常，软件团队经理是以前的技术人员和开发人员，他们习惯于以这种方式工作。这种做法是无效的，而且适得其反。幸运的是，还有另一种选择。

### The high-tech illusion   

高科技幻象

Most managers focus on technology as their principal concern, and one of the reasons for it is the High-Tech Illusion – a conviction that dealing with any aspect of new technology equals being in a high-tech business.   

大多数管理者都把技术作为他们的主要关注点，其中一个原因是高科技幻觉--一种相信处理新技术的任何方面都等同于从事高科技业务的信念。

However, only those researchers who made breakthroughs can confidently say they are in the high-tech business, while people using new technology components to develop their products are just appliers of their work.  

然而，只有那些取得突破的研究人员才能自信地说他们是从事高科技行业的，而使用新技术组件开发产品的人只是他们工作的应用者。

And since these new technologies are applied in teams and projects, it would be fair to say that “appliers” are actually in the human communication business. Logically, the successes and failures are the results of human interactions, whether good or poor.   

由于这些新技术应用于团队和项目中，可以公平地说，“应用者”实际上是人类通信业务。从逻辑上讲，成功和失败是人类互动的结果，无论是好的还是坏的。

Of course, it’s much easier to handle the technological side of work than the human one – for example, it’s easier to install a disk drive than to explain why an employee wants to quit. But eventually, it’s the human side that matters.    

当然，处理工作的技术方面要比处理人的方面容易得多--例如，安装磁盘驱动器比解释员工为什么想辞职容易得多。但最终，人性的一面才是最重要的。

### “Make a cheeseburger, sell a cheeseburger”  

“做芝士汉堡卖芝士汉堡”

According to the authors, a serious problem that can be fatal in any development area is the “make the cheeseburger, sell a cheeseburger” mentality – which is an approach to management consisting in standardizing procedures, eliminating experimentation, and treating workers as if they were interchangeable parts of a machine.   

根据作者的说法，在任何开发领域都可能致命的一个严重问题是“制作奶酪汉堡包，销售奶酪汉堡包”的心态-这是一种管理方法，包括标准化程序，消除实验，并将工人视为机器的可互换部件。

This approach, successfully applied in a production environment like fast food business, doesn’t work in the IT sphere: it limits the freedom of thought as people are not allowed to make mistakes. However, workers should be encouraged to do so:  

这种方法在快餐业等生产环境中得到了成功应用，但在IT领域却行不通：它限制了思想的自由，因为人们不允许犯错误。但是，应鼓励工人这样做：

> _For most thinking workers, making an occasional mistake is a natural and healthy part of their work. But there can be an almost Biblical association between error on the job and sin. This is an attitude we need to take specific pains to change.  
> 
> 对于大多数有思想的工作者来说，偶尔犯一个错误是他们工作中自然而健康的一部分。但是，在工作中的错误和罪之间可以有一种几乎是圣经的联系。这是一种我们需要特别努力改变的态度。_

### “The Spanish theory of value”  

《西班牙价值理论》

Another thing which negatively impacts management, say the authors, is the Spanish Theory of Value – the theory, according to which there is only fixed amount of value on earth, which means it has to be extracted and accumulated (drawn from the Spanish invasion into the New World, where they exploited the indigenous people and extracted huge amount of gold.)   

作者说，另一个对管理产生负面影响的是西班牙价值理论，根据该理论，地球上只有固定数量的价值，这意味着它必须被提取和积累（从西班牙入侵新世界中得出，他们在那里剥削土著人民并提取了大量的黄金。

Unfortunately, this approach is still popular among many managers: they treat productivity as extracting more in an hour of work – not achieving, but extracting. This often leads to unpaid overtime.  

不幸的是，这种方法仍然在许多管理者中流行：他们认为生产力是在一小时的工作中提取更多的东西--不是实现，而是提取。这往往导致无薪加班。

Making employees work longer and harder, managers make them sacrifice their private lives. Very often this is done through imposing tight deadlines, sometimes arbitrary (after all, the world will not collapse if a project won’t be finished by April, right?)  

为了让员工工作更长时间、更努力，管理者让他们牺牲自己的私生活。通常情况下，这是通过强加严格的最后期限来完成的，有时是任意的（毕竟，如果一个项目在4月前不能完成，世界就不会崩溃，对吗？））

But no one can work hard continually and with the same intensity: the efficiency will be decreased, and even the most dedicated workaholics will start to feel that they don’t want to let their life pass them by.  

但没有人能持续地、以同样的强度努力工作：工作效率会降低，即使是最专注的工作狂也会开始觉得他们不想让自己的生命从他们身边溜走。

To illustrate how this may feel, the authors quote some paragraphs from Billy Joel’s “The Stranger”:  

为了说明这种感觉，作者引用了比利·乔尔的“陌生人”中的一些段落：

> _Slow down you crazy child,  
> 
> 慢点你这个疯孩子_

> _And take the phone off the hook and disappear for a while.  
> 
> 把电话摘下来然后消失一段时间。_

> _It’s all right. You can afford to lose a day or two.  
> 
> 没关系。你可以损失一两天。_

>  _When will you realize . . . Vienna waits for you?  
> 
> 你什么时候才会明白。. .维也纳在等你？_

### The seven false hopes of software management  

软件管理的七个错误希望

To summarize the problems a manager may encounter, the authors use a metaphor of the Seven Sirens: like the sirens from the ancient epic poem tried to seduce Odysseus with their songs and then kill him, some widely accepted beliefs can prevent a manager from building a healthy corporate culture.   

为了总结管理者可能遇到的问题，作者使用了七个警报器的比喻：就像古代史诗中的海妖试图用歌声引诱奥德修斯，然后杀死他一样，一些被广泛接受的信念会阻止经理建立健康的企业文化。

Describing the Seven False Hopes of Software Management, they provide a response that counters each of them:  

在描述软件管理的七个错误希望时，他们提供了一个针对每个错误希望的回应：

1.  There is a productivity trick you’ve missed. – Response: You are not dumb enough to miss something so fundamental.  
    
    你错过了一个提高生产力的窍门。回答：你不会傻到错过如此重要的东西。
2.  Other managers get gains of 100, 200 percent or more. – Response: Forget it.  
    
    其他经理获得100%，200%或更多的收益。答案：忘了它。
3.  Technology is moving so quickly that you’re falling behind. – Response: While machines do change quickly, the business of software development stays the same.  
    
    技术发展如此之快，以至于你落后了。- 回应：虽然机器变化很快，但软件开发的业务保持不变。
4.  Changing languages gives gains. – Response: Yes, but only on the implementation stage.  
    
    改变语言带来收益。- 答复：有，但仅在执行阶段。
5.  Backlog makes you double productivity immediately. – Response: Some projects are economic losers, and need to be in a reject pile, not in the backlog.  
    
    积压工作会让你的工作效率立刻翻倍。- 回应：有些项目是经济上的输家，需要放在废品堆里，而不是积压。
6.  It’s about time you automated your software development staff. – Response: What software developers do is not easily automated work; it’s mostly communication.  
    
    是时候让你的软件开发人员自动化了。- 回应：软件开发人员所做的不是容易实现自动化的工作;主要是交流
7.  People work better under pressure. – Response: No, they just enjoy it less.  
    
    人们在压力下工作得更好。回答：不，他们只是不太喜欢。

## Part II. The office environment  

第二部分.办公环境

To create a healthy and work-conductive environment, a good manager would have to eliminate the factors that make this impossible. The causes of lost time are numerous, and they lead to frustration, so managers need to do something about it – as the authors say, “There are a million ways to lose a workday, but not even a single way to get one back.”  

为了创造一个健康的、有利于工作的环境，一个好的管理者必须消除使之不可能实现的因素。浪费时间的原因有很多，而且会导致沮丧，所以管理者需要采取一些措施-正如作者所说，“有一百万种方法可以浪费一个工作日，但甚至没有一种方法可以让一个工作日回来。

### The furniture police 家具警察

Unfortunately, people who control space for a company, especially for a large organization, rarely think about the comfort of people who work there – usually they don’t take into account the ways in which people use their space, the number of hours they work alone and with someone else, often completely disregarding a natural need for peace and quiet.   

不幸的是，为公司，尤其是大型组织控制空间的人很少考虑在那里工作的人的舒适度-通常他们不会考虑人们使用空间的方式，他们独自工作或与他人一起工作的时间，通常完全无视对和平与安静的自然需求。

What they care about is leaving a desk clean for the night, not hanging anything on walls but calendars and so on. This is why the authors call them “furniture police”, emphasizing that they design workplaces like prisons: striving for uniformity and optimizing for containment at minimal cost.  

他们关心的是晚上把桌子打扫干净，不在墙上挂任何东西，而是日历等等。这就是为什么作者称他们为“家具警察”，强调他们设计的工作场所就像监狱一样：以最小的成本努力实现均匀性并优化容纳。

A typical workspace where intellectual workers spend their day is “noisy, interruptive, unprivate, and sterile.” For example, from the viewpoint of the Furniture Police, basement space is really preferable as it creates similar conditions to everyone, this way adding uniformity. However, these workspaces are not functional, and not much work can be done there.  

一个典型的工作场所，智力工作者花他们的一天是“嘈杂，中断，不私密，无菌。”例如，从家具警察的角度来看，地下室空间确实更可取，因为它为每个人创造了类似的条件，这种方式增加了统一性。然而，这些工作区并不具有功能，并且在那里可以完成的工作不多。

People work better in natural light; moreover, they want their space to be shaped to their own convenience and taste. Doors are as important as windows are: they help control noise and interruptibility. A simple rule is that comfort benefits productivity, but very often this rule is ignored.  

人们在自然光下工作得更好;此外，他们还希望自己的空间能按照自己的方便和品味来设计。门和窗户一样重要：它们有助于控制噪声和可中断性。一个简单的规则是，舒适有利于生产力，但往往这条规则被忽视。

### Coding war games

Some time before they wrote this book, the authors conducted a public productivity survey which grew into a kind of competition: teams of software implementers competed to complete coding and testing tasks with minimal defects and in minimal time. They called these competitions Coding War Games.

Analyzing the results, they discovered that the following factors had little or no correlation to performance:

1.  Language – those who coded in old languages (COBOL or Fortran) did as well as those who coded in Pascal;  
    
    语言-那些用旧语言（COBOL或Fortran）编码的人和用Pascal编码的人做得一样好;
2.  Years of experience – people with ten years of experience didn’t outperform those who had less experience;  
    
    经验年数--有十年经验的人并不比经验少的人表现好;
3.  Number of defects – zero-defect workers took slightly less time to complete a task;  
    
    缺陷数量-零缺陷工人完成任务所需的时间略少;
4.  Salary – a relationship between salary and performance was weak.  
    
    工资-工资与业绩之间的关系很弱。

These findings may be surprising, but probably not as surprising as the factors that actually affect performance:  

这些发现可能令人惊讶，但可能不如实际影响性能的因素那么令人惊讶：

-   It matters who your pair mate is: if your mate works well and finishes the project on time, so will you, and vice versa. The members of the pairs participating in the experiment came from the same organizations, so they shared the same physical environment and the same corporate culture. The authors made the following suggestion:  
    
    重要的是你的伴侣是谁：如果你的伴侣工作出色并按时完成了项目，你也会如此，反之亦然。参与实验的两组成员来自同一个组织，因此他们共享相同的物理环境和相同的企业文化。作者提出了以下建议：

> _Two people from the same organization tend to perform alike. That means the best performers are clustering in some organizations while the worst performers are clustering in others.  
> 
> 来自同一组织的两个人往往表现相似。这意味着表现最好的人聚集在一些组织中，而表现最差的人聚集在其他组织中。_

-   Effects of the workplace. People who perform better tend to work in organizations that provide a better workplace. The environment where the best performers worked was acceptable, quiet and private, people were able to silence their phones and divert calls, and they didn’t interrupt each other needlessly.  
    
    工作场所的影响。表现更好的人往往在提供更好工作场所的组织中工作。表现最好的员工工作的环境是可以接受的，安静而私密，人们能够将手机静音并转移呼叫，而且他们不会不必要地打断对方。

The results of this experiment prove that work environment matters a lot, and it’s possible to help your employees work more effectively, simply organizing their space better.  

这个实验的结果证明，工作环境很重要，它可以帮助你的员工更有效地工作，只是更好地组织他们的空间。

### Alexander’s concept of organic order  

亚历山大的有机秩序概念

To create an ideal workspace, the authors suggest using the idea of “organic order”, developed by Christopher Alexander, an architect and a philosopher. He describes organic order as an environment that “emerges when there is perfect balance between the needs of the individual parts of the environment, and the needs of the whole.”  

为了创造一个理想的工作空间，作者建议使用由建筑师兼哲学家克里斯托弗·亚历山大提出的“有机秩序”的概念。他将有机秩序描述为一种环境，“当环境中各个部分的需求与整体需求之间达到完美平衡时，这种环境就会出现。”

According to Alexander, people cannot work effectively in an environment which is too enclosed or too exposed; they feel more comfortable with a wall behind them, and uncomfortable if there is a blank wall closer than 8 feet in front of them. He suggests 253 patterns of successful interior order; the authors add 4 more, aiming at 4 the most failing patterns of modern institutional space:

1.  Tailored work space from a kit. Instead of providing individual modules for each person, it makes more sense to fashion space around working groups;
2.  Windows. “Rooms without a view are like prisons for the people who have to stay in them.”
3.  Indoor and outdoor space. Space with an outdoor component is definitely more comfortable.
4.  Public space. This is a space for group interactions that needs tables and seating for the whole group, as well as writing surfaces and, preferably, a space to prepare meals together.

Finally, organizing space for employees, designers must follow a “non-replicable formula” – like two people cannot be alike, their workplaces cannot be alike either.  

最后，为员工安排空间，设计师必须遵循一个“不可复制的公式”--就像两个人不可能一样，他们的工作场所也不可能一样。

## Part III. The right people  

第三部分合适的人

Modern management science focuses on the boss as the principal strategist and tactician, and pays little attention to hiring and keeping the right people. Of course, this is a flawed approach: all work is done at the level of the team - and team means workers, not a manager.  

现代管理科学关注的是老板是主要的战略家和战术家，很少关注招聘和留住合适的人。当然，这是一种有缺陷的方法：所有的工作都是在团队层面上完成的--团队意味着工人，而不是经理。

### Code word: professional 代号：专业

Even novice managers know the golden rule: you cannot hire based on appearance. However, it often happens that appearance is one of the key factors in hiring. Why is it so? The authors explain that the reason is our evolutionary mechanisms: we feel uneasy around people who differ from us.   

即使是新手经理也知道黄金法则：你不能以外表来招聘。然而，经常发生的情况是，外观是招聘的关键因素之一。为什么会这样呢？作者解释说，原因是我们的进化机制：我们在与自己不同的人身边感到不安。

Hiring a person, you hire them on behalf of the whole company, thinking they fit into its culture. If the culture is healthy, it’s not a problem – if most employees are good performers, then if a new one is like them, it only benefits the company. But if not? Then you just lose a chance to hire someone who can be a breath of fresh air.  

雇用一个人，你代表整个公司雇用他们，认为他们符合公司的文化。如果企业文化是健康的，这不是问题--如果大多数员工都表现良好，那么如果一个新员工像他们一样，这只会让公司受益。但如果不是呢？那你就失去了一个雇佣一个能给你带来新鲜空气的人的机会。

Uniformity is important to authoritarian regimes; however, a strong desire to impose uniformity tells about unconfidence, say the authors:   

统一性对专制政权很重要;然而，作者说，强烈的统一愿望说明了不信任：

> _The need for uniformity is a sign of insecurity on the part of management. Strong managers don’t care when team members cut their hair or whether they wear ties. Their pride is tied only to their staff’s accomplishments.  
> 
> 对统一性的需求是管理层不安全的标志。强有力的管理者不在乎团队成员何时剪头发或是否打领带。他们的骄傲只与员工的成就有关。_

This is why “unprofessional” is often viewed as a surprising and threatening behavior. For example, a manager of one company once called pop-corn unprofessional – because the connotations of its smell have nothing to do with work. Long hair on a male head can be called unprofessional for the same reason – because it’s unusual.  

这就是为什么“不专业”经常被视为一种令人惊讶和威胁的行为。例如，一家公司的经理曾称爆米花不专业，因为它的气味与工作无关。男性头上的长发也可以被称为不专业，因为这是不寻常的。

Conversely, the term “professional” means something that is not surprising. This way, if you think like everyone else, dress like everyone else, you are considered professional. Of course, this “perverted sense of professionalism”, as the authors call it, has nothing to do with reality: professionalism is about competence and knowledge.  

相反，术语“专业”意味着一些并不令人惊讶的事情。这样，如果你像其他人一样思考，像其他人一样穿着，你被认为是专业的。当然，这种“变态的专业感”，正如作者所说，与现实毫无关系：专业精神是关于能力和知识的。

### Turnover and the mentality of permanence  

周转与恒久心态

According to the authors, a typical person leaves after two years of work. To hire a new employee, it costs between 4 or 5 months’ salary – because it takes a couple months for a new person to start doing some useful work, and around 5 month to work at a full capacity. This is the obvious side of turnover. There is also a hidden one.  

据提交人说，典型的人在工作两年后离开。雇佣一个新员工，需要花费4到5个月的工资--因为一个新员工需要几个月的时间才能开始做一些有用的工作，大约5个月的时间才能满负荷工作。这是营业额明显的一面。还有一个隐藏的。

In companies with high turnover, people tend to have a short-term viewpoint – knowing that they will probably leave soon, they do not fully devote themselves to the company. The only way to keep workers is to promote them quickly – which means promoting people with little experience, and this is not a sign of health.  

在高流动率的公司，人们往往有一个短期的观点-知道他们可能很快就会离开，他们没有完全投入到公司。留住工人的唯一办法就是迅速提拔他们--这意味着提拔经验少的人，而这并不是健康的标志。

So how can we avoid turnover? First of all, we should remember that people stay when they are expected to stay. To make employees feel that they are valuable, a company should invest in their growth: for example, telling them to go through training and retraining.  

那么，我们如何避免周转呢？首先，我们应该记住，人们应该留下来的时候，他们应该留下来。为了让员工觉得自己是有价值的，公司应该投资于他们的成长：比如说让他们去培训再培训。

The best organizations do not fire people who need retraining, hiring someone who has the necessary skill: they know that retraining builds the mentality of permanence and, consequently, a strong sense of community.  

最好的组织不会解雇需要再培训的人，而是雇佣具备必要技能的人：他们知道再培训能培养一种持久的心态，从而培养一种强烈的社区意识。

## Part IV. Growing productive teams  

第四编.不断成长的高效团队

People tend to work more effectively if they work as a cohesive unit: “Once a team begins to jell, the probability of success goes up dramatically.” The reason why this happens is very simple: teams are formed around goals.  

如果人们作为一个有凝聚力的单位工作，他们往往会更有效地工作：“一旦一个团队开始凝心聚力，成功的可能性就会急剧上升。”发生这种情况的原因很简单：团队是围绕目标而形成的。

### Teamicide 团队杀手

Speaking about productive teams, the authors mention ways that inhibit the formation of teams. They call these ways “teamicide”, and provide the following techniques that provoke it:  

在谈到高效团队时，作者提到了抑制团队形成的方法。他们称这些方式为“团队杀戮”，并提供了以下技术来挑起它：

1.  Defensive management. It happens when a manager feels insecure and cannot protect himself from his team’s incompetence. But the problem is, the defensive tactics only makes things worse: once you’ve started leading a group, the best you can do is to trust them. People will make mistakes, but this is normal, so let them do it.  
    
    防御性管理。当一个经理感到没有安全感，无法保护自己免受团队无能的影响时，就会发生这种情况。但问题是，防守战术只会让事情变得更糟：一旦你开始领导一个团队，你所能做的就是信任他们。人们会犯错误，但这是正常的，所以让他们去做吧。
2.  Bureaucracy. “Pushing paper” really hurts team building as it steals time from achieving goals, even if these are arbitrary.  
    
    官僚主义。“推纸”真的伤害了团队建设，因为它从实现目标中窃取了时间，即使这些目标是任意的。
3.  Physical separation. It doesn’t make any sense to separate people who are supposed to work together: if they work on the same thing, they tend to make less noise.  
    
    物理分离。把应该一起工作的人分开是没有意义的：如果他们在同一件事上工作，他们往往会发出更少的噪音。
4.  Fragmentation. It has a bad impact on both efficiency and team building. Assigning one piece of work at a time can considerably decrease fragmentation.  
    
    支离破碎。这对效率和团队建设都有不良影响。一次分配一件工作可以大大减少碎片化。
5.  The reduced product quality. Trying to deliver a product sooner, we often compromise the quality. This can demotivate developers who are actually capable of building a better product.  
    
    产品质量下降。为了更快地交付产品，我们常常牺牲质量。这可能会使实际上有能力构建更好产品的开发人员失去动力。
6.  Phony deadlines. People don’t believe in arbitrary deadlines dates anymore. It cannot be considered as an enjoyable challenge.  
    
    假的最后期限。人们不再相信任意的截止日期。这不能被认为是一个令人愉快的挑战。
7.  Clique control. The team phenomenon happens at the bottom of the company hierarchy. The only case when managers can become a part of a team is when they act both as managers and a group member.  
    
    派系控制。团队现象发生在公司层级的最底层。管理者成为团队一员的唯一情况是他们既是管理者又是团队成员。

### Chemistry for team formation  

团队形成的化学

As opposed to the techniques mentioned above, the authors provide a list of “chemistry-building strategies for a healthy organization” – the elements that have a positive effect on team-building:  

与上面提到的技术相反，作者提供了一个“健康组织的化学构建策略”列表-对团队建设有积极影响的元素：

1.  The cult of quality. When team members do the best they can, it protects the company from short-term economics.  
    
    对质量的崇拜。当团队成员尽其所能时，它可以保护公司免受短期经济的影响。
2.  Satisfying closure. Dividing work in pieces and making sure that each piece can be completed in a visible way gives workers a chance to feel accomplished.  
    
    令人满意的结束。将工作分成几部分，并确保每一部分都能以可见的方式完成，这会让员工有机会感到自己完成了工作。
3.  A sense of eliteness. A team can – and should – be unique in some sense. This specific feature that makes them special is an important ingredient of a jelled team.  
    
    一种精英的感觉。一个团队在某种意义上可以而且应该是独一无二的。这种使他们与众不同的特点是一个团结的团队的重要组成部分。
4.  Heterogeneity. A heterogeneous element, whoever this is, makes other team members understand it’s okay to not be like everyone else.  
    
    异质性。一个异质元素，不管这是谁，都会让其他团队成员明白不像其他人一样是可以的。
5.  Preserve and protect successful teams. Remember that a team is a network, not a hierarchy.  
    
    维护和保护成功的团队。记住，团队是一个网络，而不是一个层次。

> _What’s in the foreground of most of our prized work memories is team interaction. When a group of people fuse into a meaningful whole, the entire character of the work changes. The challenge of the work is important, but not in and of itself; it is important because it gives us something to focus on together.  
> 
> 在我们最宝贵的工作记忆的前景是团队互动。当一群人融合成一个有意义的整体时，作品的整个性格就发生了变化。工作的挑战很重要，但并不重要;它很重要，因为它使我们能够共同关注。_

## Part V. Fertile soil 第五部分肥沃的土壤

Corporate culture is the context in which teams and projects exist. Some cultures are healthy, while others aren’t. So what are the factors that make a corporate culture healthy?  

企业文化是团队和项目存在的环境。有些文化是健康的，而有些则不是。那么，是什么因素使企业文化健康发展呢？

### Meetings, monologues, and conversations  

会议、独白和对话

When it comes to meetings, organizations tend to act in two ways, totally opposite to each other: being addicted to them or, as the authors joke, refusing to use the “M” word at all. Naturally, neither of the two is good.  

当涉及到会议时，组织往往会以两种方式行事，彼此完全相反：沉迷于它们，或者像作者开玩笑的那样，根本拒绝使用“M”这个词。当然，两者都不是好的。

To make meetings an effective instrument, the authors suggest using “meeting hygiene” – a specific attitude that helps extract meaning from these interactions.  

为了使会议成为一种有效的工具，作者建议使用“会议卫生”--一种有助于从这些互动中提取意义的特定态度。

First of all, you’d need to differentiate between working and non-working meetings. A working meeting is the one which is called to reach a decision, and it’s supposed to have an agenda relevant to its purpose. They are not finished by the clock – they are finished when the decision is made.  

首先，你需要区分工作会议和非工作会议。工作会议是为了达成一项决定而召开的会议，它应该有一个与其目的相关的议程。他们不是按时钟完成的-他们是在做出决定的时候完成的。

A nonworking meeting ends by the clock since it doesn’t have any particular purpose. This is why the authors call it a ceremony: it’s about FYI, for your information thing. A ceremony is conducted in a ritualistic manner: announcements and interactions between two people, typically a boss and one of the subordinates, while the others are listening.  

非工作会议按时钟结束，因为它没有任何特定的目的。这就是为什么作者称之为仪式：这是关于你的信息仪式以仪式的方式进行：两个人之间的公告和互动，通常是一个老板和一个下属，而其他人在听。

The “meeting hygiene” consists in eliminating ceremonial meetings, limiting attendance at working meetings (since sometimes these are used as a chance to get visibility and rise in the company hierarchy) focusing on one-on-one conversations instead.  

“会议卫生”包括取消仪式性会议，限制出席工作会议（因为有时这些会议被用来作为获得知名度和在公司层级中提升的机会），而是专注于一对一的对话。

### Making change possible 使变革成为可能

Technologies change, and make software development change the way products are built. However, changes are not easy. And the thing that makes a change process even more difficult is the wrong understanding of the nature of change.  

技术在改变，并使软件开发改变了产品的构建方式。然而，改变并不容易。而使变革过程变得更加困难的是对变革本质的错误理解。

A model of change as it is typically imagined by the majority of people is very simple: old status quo – new status quo (linked with a better idea). As opposed to this naïve model, there is a different one – a Satir change model that involves 4 elements:  

大多数人通常想象的变革模式非常简单：旧的现状-新的现状（与更好的想法相联系）。与这种天真的模型相反，还有一个不同的模型--萨提尔改变模型，它涉及四个要素：

1.  Old status quo 旧现状
2.  Chaos. At this stage, you go through doubts, feeling worse off.    
    
    混乱。在这个阶段，你会经历怀疑，感觉更糟。
3.  Practice and integration. You don’t feel completely comfortable yet but you start to see the prospects.  
    
    实践与整合。你还没有完全感到舒服，但你开始看到前景。
4.  New status quo. 新的现状。

> _You have reached the New Status Quo when what you changed becomes what you do. An interesting characteristic of human emotion is that the more painful the Chaos, the greater the perceived value of the New Status Quo—if you can get there.  
> 
> 当你改变的事情变成你所做的事情时，你已经达到了新的现状。人类情感的一个有趣的特征是，混乱越痛苦，新状态的感知价值就越大-如果你能到达那里的话。_

## Part VI. It’s supposed to be fun to work here  

第六编.在这里工作应该很有趣

We’re used to the thought that work has to be hard - otherwise it’s not work. And if you enjoy it, you shouldn’t be paid for it. However, the authors tell us that this is not necessarily true.  

我们习惯于认为工作必须是艰苦的--否则就不是工作。如果你喜欢它，你不应该为此付出代价。然而，作者告诉我们，这不一定是真的。

### Chaos and order 混沌与秩序

> _There is something about human nature that makes us the implacable enemies of chaos. Whenever we encounter chaos, we roll up our sleeves and go right to work to replace it with order. But it does not follow from this that we’d be happier if there were no more chaos. On the contrary, we’d be bored to tears.  
> 
> 人性中有某种东西使我们成为混乱的死敌。每当我们遇到混乱，我们卷起袖子，直接去工作，以秩序取代它。但这并不意味着，如果没有更多的混乱，我们会更快乐。相反，我们会无聊到流泪。_

Even though we try to get rid of chaos by all means, a little of it can breathe some energy into work. There are some techniques how to implement the policy of “reintroduction of small amounts of disorder”, as the authors put it:  

即使我们试图通过各种手段摆脱混乱，一点点混乱也能为工作带来一些能量。有一些技术如何执行“重新引入少量的混乱”的政策，正如作者所说：

1.  Pilot projects. Starting a pilot project, you try new techniques, sometimes unproved, and let yourself not follow the standards. The only thing you should remember here is that it’s better not to experiment with more than one aspect of development technology on one project.  
    
    试点项目。开始一个试点项目，你尝试新的技术，有时未经证实，让自己不遵循标准。这里您唯一应该记住的是，最好不要在一个项目中尝试开发技术的多个方面。
2.  War games. You can announce a 24-hour Project Tournament, to have employees compare their performance to the performance of their peers.  
    
    战争游戏。你可以宣布一个24小时的项目锦标赛，让员工将自己的表现与同事的表现进行比较。
3.  Brainstorming. Emphasize that this brainstorming is about the quantity of ideas, not about quality – this experience might be disorderly, but it can end up being rewarding.  
    
    头脑风暴强调头脑风暴是关于想法的数量，而不是质量-这种经历可能是无序的，但最终可能是有益的。
4.  Training, trips, conferences, celebrations, and retreats. To give employees an opportunity to fly to a conference together, to eat out together, etc. is a great idea – getting them out of the office together will have a positive impact on their relationships.  
    
    培训，旅行，会议，庆祝活动和务虚会。给予员工有机会一起坐飞机去开会，一起出去吃饭等等是个好主意--让他们一起离开办公室会对他们的关系产生积极的影响。

Sometimes things that hurt the work environment are silly, and it doesn’t take much to “wake up a giant” – a serious issue can be brought up by a simple incident that would be the last straw. Someday, one of your employees can lose patience and say “This is not acceptable ” – and it will be a point of no return.   

有时候，伤害工作环境的事情是愚蠢的，“唤醒一个巨人”并不需要太多-一个严重的问题可以由一个简单的事件，这将是最后一根稻草。有一天，你的一个员工可能会失去耐心，说“这是不可接受的”-这将是一个不归路。

The employees of any organization are like the body of this sleeping giant, and when the giant is mad, something has to be done about it - no one will tolerate the situation anymore.  

任何组织的员工都像是这个沉睡的巨人的身体，当巨人发疯的时候，就必须做点什么--没有人会再容忍这种情况了。

And yes, even one single voice can change everything.  

是的，一个声音就能改变一切。
